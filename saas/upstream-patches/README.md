# Upstream patch queue

Every `.patch` must have a ledger entry recording its owner, affected upstream
paths, tests, upstream issue or pull request, first/last replayed revisions, and
removal condition. Runtime monkey patches and whole-file overrides are not
accepted.

| Patch | Owner | Upstream path | Verification | Upstream status | Replay baseline | Removal condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0002-managed-session-initializer.patch` | SaaS Platform | `omnigent/db/utils.py` | Store adapter contract; shared-read bypass; real PostgreSQL Runtime RLS | Generic extension proposal pending | `9303cc1c` | Remove when upstream exposes a per-transaction Store session initializer or equivalent hook |
| `0003-managed-runtime-adapter-seams.patch` | SaaS Platform | `omnigent/host/connect.py`; `omnigent/llms/_usage_observer.py` | official Host/usage-observer tests; managed Provider metering adapter tests | Generic Host factory, Runner entry-module, and required usage-sink extension proposal pending | `9303cc1c` | Remove when upstream exposes equivalent Host construction, Runner entrypoint, and fail-closed accounting seams |
